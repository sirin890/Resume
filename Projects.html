            • Title: Java<br><br>

            • Description:
            <p>
                The Problem and the idea:
We want to build a system that helps fitness and health clubs 
handle all transactions all in one place, so no data would be lost or hard to 
manage. The system will manage the memberships, the coaches and the 
workout classes given. We want to build a system that subscribe new 
client and new trainers, display their information, assign them to workout 
session, and store all the data in files.

        • Title: Thermal Imaging Attacks<br><br>

        • Description:
        <p>
            This video aims to spread awareness to the general population about thermal imaging attacks. 
Attacks that use thermal cameras to detect the heat trace on keyboard or touchscreen to reconstruct
victim password. We want to increase the awareness of individuals in terms of reducing the possibility 
of stealing private passwords by 70% by thieves who use thermal imaging devices through ways that 
the individual does, which helps them to increase the difficulty for the thief to know the password. We 
are committed to spread awareness to the Saudi public about the threats of the thermal imaging attack 
and the protection methods they should take for defense. Most, if not all the time, we don’t check our 
surroundings when entering a password into a device. Thermal imaging attacks are so simple that they 
can be done over the shoulder without notice. We will start by taking enough notes about people's 
awareness of the problem during the next week, and then in the following weeks, we will create an 
awareness video about thermal imaging attacks. We will finish after 5 weeks, which is before our 
deadline on 11 February.
